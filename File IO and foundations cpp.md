### Part 1: C++ Foundations - Building My Code's Brain üß±

* **Compilers (g++, Clang):** These are my personal translators. I write C++, they turn it into machine instructions the computer understands. Simple!
* **Undefined Behavior (UB):** This is the BIGGEST DANGER! üëª If I break a C++ rule (like trying to use memory I don't own), the program goes wild and does unpredictable things. My defense? Always compile with `-Wall -Wextra` to catch these sneaky potential issues early!
* **Namespaces (std):** These are like organized rooms in my code house. `std::` keeps things tidy and prevents names from clashing. I use it to be clear about what `std` tool I'm using.
* **`main` Return Code:** This is my program's final report card to the operating system. `0` means "All good, mission accomplished!" üéâ Any other number means "Houston, we have a problem!" ‚ùå

### Part 2: Handling Data - My Code's Hands & Mouth üìù

* **`std::string`:** My best friend for text! It's a smart container that handles all the messy memory stuff for me when I deal with words and sentences. Way easier and safer than old-school C strings.
* **`\n` vs `std::endl`:** This is about speed!
    * `\n`: Just a new line character. Super fast. Use it most of the time.
    * `std::endl`: New line AND forces the output to appear immediately by flushing the buffer. This is slower. I only use this when I really need a message to show up right away (like for critical error messages or debugging).
* **`std::cerr`:** My dedicated emergency broadcast system. Messages sent here show up instantly, even if my program crashes, because it's usually unbuffered.
* **`std::vector`:** My dynamic array superhero! üí™ It's like a list that automatically grows or shrinks. It stores elements right next to each other in memory (contiguous), just like a traditional array. Crucially, it manages memory on the heap for me, so I don't have to worry about `new` and `delete` myself. It's part of the awesome Standard Template Library (STL).
* **File I/O (`<fstream>`):** This is how my code talks to files on the computer.
    * `std::ifstream`: For reading.
    * `std::ofstream`: For writing.
    * `std::ios::binary`: ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL for binary files (like ROMs)! ü§´ This flag tells the stream to read/write raw bytes exactly as they are, without any character translations (e.g., changing Windows newlines to Unix newlines). Without it, my binary data will be corrupted.
* **`std::isprint()`:** Helps me check if a character is something I can actually see on screen. Pro-tip: Always cast my `char` to `static_cast<unsigned char>` before passing it to `std::isprint()` to prevent potential Undefined Behavior with negative `char` values.
* **Manipulators (`std::setw`, `std::setfill`, `std::hex`):** My output stylists! They make my hex dumps look neat and organized.

### üåê WebAssembly Deep Dive: Bringing My C++ to the Web - The Master Plan üöÄ

This is where my C++ code gets its web superpowers! ‚ú®

#### 1. The WebAssembly Ecosystem üï∏Ô∏è

* **WebAssembly (Wasm):** The compiled form of my C++ code that web browsers understand. It's super fast, compact, and runs directly in the browser.
* **Emscripten SDK (emsdk):** My ultimate WebAssembly toolkit! It's the official way to install and manage all the compilers and tools I need (like `emcc`, Node.js, Python) for compiling C++ to WebAssembly.
* **`emcc`:** My special compiler for WebAssembly. I use it just like `g++`, but it spits out `.wasm` (the binary code) and `.js` (the JavaScript "glue" code).

#### 2. C++ for Web (`main_web.cpp` Secrets) ü§´

* `#include <emscripten/emscripten.h>`: The essential header that unlocks all the Emscripten-specific magic for my C++ code.
* `EMSCRIPTEN_KEEPALIVE`: This is my "Don't touch this function!" sign. I put it right before a C++ function's return type. It tells `emcc` not to remove this function during optimization, because I want JavaScript to be able to call it directly. Keep it "alive"!
* `extern "C"`: This is like giving my C++ function a simple, easy-to-find name for JavaScript. When I use this, C++ doesn't "mangle" the function name into something complex. The compiled name will typically have a leading underscore (`_`). This is crucial for JS interop!

#### 3. The Makefile - My WebAssembly Recipe Book üìú

This file tells `emcc` exactly how to build my web app. This was a tricky but vital part!

* `CXX = emcc`: Simply tells `make` to use the Emscripten compiler instead of `g++`.
* **The `CXXFLAGS` (Compiler Flags) - My Secret Sauce!**
    * `-s WASM=1`: "Make a Wasm file!"
    * `-s MODULARIZE=1 -s EXPORT_NAME="createModule"`: "Wrap my Wasm code in a neat ES6 JavaScript module, and make the main function to initialize it called `createModule`." This makes loading super clean and asynchronous.
    * `-s EXPORTED_FUNCTIONS="['_processFileForHexView', '_malloc', '_free']"`: AHA! This was a big one that caused "undefined symbol" errors! I have to tell `emcc` the exact names of the C-linked C++ functions (including that crucial leading underscore from `extern "C"`) that JavaScript needs to access. If I miss the underscore here, `emcc` can't find them!
    * `-s EXPORTED_RUNTIME_METHODS="['cwrap', 'stringToUTF8', 'HEAPU8']"`: Another "AHA!" moment that fixed `Module.cwrap is not a function`! This explicitly tells `emcc` to expose its own internal helper functions (`cwrap` for wrapping, `stringToUTF8` for string conversion) and the Wasm memory (`HEAPU8`) directly to my JavaScript. Without this, JS can't find them!
    * `-s ALLOW_MEMORY_GROWTH=1`: "Let Wasm memory expand if my program needs more (e.g., for big files)."
    * `-s MALLOC=emmalloc`: "Use Emscripten's optimized memory allocator."
    * `--no-entry`: "My C++ `main` function runs once on startup, then JavaScript will take over and call other C++ functions."
* **Output Target (`-o hex_viewer_web.js`):** When I tell `emcc` to output a `.js` file, it automatically creates the corresponding `.wasm` file right alongside it.

#### 4. JavaScript Bridge - My Web Page Talks to C++ üó£Ô∏è

This is the JavaScript in `index.html` that makes everything interactive and connects my web page to my compiled C++ code.

* **Loading the Glue Code:** `<script src="hex_viewer_web.js"></script>` loads the JavaScript generated by `emcc`. Key Intel: I removed the `async` attribute here to ensure `hex_viewer_web.js` loads and defines `createModule` before my own inline script tries to use it. This fixed "`createModule` is not defined" errors!
* **Wasm Initialization (`createModule().then(Module => { ... })`):** This is my "wait until everything is ready" command. `createModule()` returns a `Promise`, and the `.then()` block executes only when the entire WebAssembly module is loaded and fully initialized. This prevents "not ready" errors and ensures all Wasm functions are available.
* **Redirecting C++ Output (`print`, `printErr`):** By passing my custom `print` and `printErr` functions to `createModule()` in the initial configuration, I tell Emscripten that any `std::cout` or `std::cerr` from my C++ code should go directly to my HTML `outputDiv` instead of the browser's console. This made the hex dump appear on the page!
* **Accessing Wasm Functions & Memory:** Inside the `onRuntimeInitialized` callback (which is part of the `createModule` configuration):
    * `wasm_malloc = Module._malloc;`: Gets a direct reference to Emscripten's memory allocation function.
    * `wasm_free = Module._free;`: Gets a direct reference to Emscripten's memory deallocation function.
    * `wasm_heap_u8 = Module.HEAPU8;`: This is a direct window into Wasm's memory, like a big array of bytes that both JS and C++ can read/write.
    * `wasm_stringToUTF8 = Module.stringToUTF8;`: My helper to convert JavaScript strings into C-style strings within Wasm memory.
    * `wasm_processFileForHexView = Module.cwrap('processFileForHexView', 'void', ['number', 'number', 'number']);`: This is how I call my C++ function! `cwrap` creates a JavaScript wrapper. I give it the original C++ function name (without the `_` here!), and it handles the binding.
* **The Data Dance (Passing Data to C++):**
    1.  JS reads file/text data.
    2.  JS asks Wasm for memory: `wasm_malloc()`.
    3.  JS copies data into Wasm memory: `wasm_heap_u8.set()`.
    4.  JS converts the filename (a JavaScript string) into a C-style string in Wasm memory: `wasm_stringToUTF8()`.
    5.  JS calls my C++ function: `wasm_processFileForHexView(pointerToData, dataSize, pointerToFileName)`.
    6.  C++ does its hex magic.
    7.  JS frees the allocated Wasm memory: `wasm_free()`. Crucial for preventing memory leaks!

#### 5. Deployment & Hosting - Sharing My Creation! üöÄ

* **Local Web Server (`python3 -m http.server`):** Essential for local development! Web browsers have security restrictions (CORS, MIME types) that prevent `.js` and `.wasm` files from loading correctly if I just open `index.html` directly from my file system (`file:///`). A simple local server correctly serves these files with the right types.
* **GitHub Pages:** My free hosting service! I push my `index.html`, `.js`, and `.wasm` files to my GitHub repository, enable GitHub Pages in settings, and GitHub serves them globally. Easy peasy!
